									<p>There was need for a good savings culture to make provisions for the rainy seasons, there was also a dire need for easy access to funds when needed. Prior to the birth of the cooperative society, pioneer members of the society had been involved in several kinds of thrift contribution but there was need for something more. That was when the idea of cooperative society came up and it was embraced by all. Ever since then, it has been a great ride.</p>
